# Unified Ocean Hazard Reporting Platform for INCOIS

This project is a feature-rich, single-page web application designed as a proof-of-concept for the **Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS)**. It provides a unified platform for citizens, disaster management officials, and data analysts to report, view, and analyze ocean-related hazards.

The application operates entirely on the client-side, using the browser's `localStorage` to simulate a mock database, making it a fully functional, serverless prototype.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1\. Role-Based Dashboards

The platform offers a tailored experience for three distinct user roles:

  * **Citizen / Volunteer**: Can submit detailed hazard reports (event type, description, media), view live reports on an interactive map, and receive alerts.
  * **Disaster Management Official**: Views a high-level dashboard with priority alerts, filters all incoming reports, and utilizes AI tools to generate summaries and actionable insights.
  * **Data Analyst**: Accesses data visualization tools, including historical trend charts, and has the ability to export filtered data for further analysis.

### 2\. Interactive Map Visualization üó∫Ô∏è

A central map powered by **Leaflet.js** serves as the primary interface:

  * **Live Markers**: Reports from crowdsourced and social media sources are plotted in real-time.
  * **Heatmap Layer**: Automatically generates a heatmap to show the density and concentration of reported incidents, allowing for quick identification of hotspots.
  * **Click-to-Focus**: Clicking a report in the list automatically pans and zooms the map to its precise location.

### 3\. AI-Powered Insights with Gemini ‚ú®

The application integrates with the **Google Gemini API** to provide advanced analytical capabilities:

  * **AI Report Summarization**: Officials and analysts can instantly generate concise summaries of detailed citizen reports.
  * **AI Actionable Suggestions**: In a high-alert scenario, officials can request a bulleted list of immediate recommendations generated by the AI based on the nature of the hazard.

### 4\. Offline-First Capability üì∂

The platform is designed to be resilient in low-connectivity environments:

  * **Offline Detection**: Automatically detects when the user is offline.
  * **Local Storage Sync**: Reports submitted while offline are saved securely in the browser and are automatically synced once connectivity is restored.

## üíª Technology Stack

  * **Frontend**: HTML5, Tailwind CSS
  * **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS (ES6 Modules)
  * **Mapping**: Leaflet.js & Leaflet.heat
  * **Charting**: Chart.js
  * **Icons**: Font Awesome
  * **AI**: Google Gemini API

## üöÄ Getting Started

This application is self-contained and does not require a build process or a backend server.

### Prerequisites

  * A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
  * A Google Gemini API Key to enable the AI features.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  **(Required for AI Features) Configure the Gemini API Key:**
      * Open the `index.html` file in a text editor.
      * Find the `callGeminiAPI` function (around line 435).
      * Replace the empty string with your API key:
        ```javascript
        const apiKey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE";
        ```
4.  **Open the application:**
      * Simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
